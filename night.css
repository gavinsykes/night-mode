Set a rule for .night input. A different coloured <h1>? .night h1.
Heck, greyscale all your images in night mode? .night img { filter: grayscale(100%); }

And of course, don't forget to create a button on your page with the night-button class,
or take an already existing one and simply add the class to it. */
